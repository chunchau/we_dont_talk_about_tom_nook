# We Hate Tom Nook

This project is an organiser for those who like to track your item collection in Animal Crossing: New Horizons

## My plan / Approach

Make a database with tables for users and user's custom selection of items.
User can select a wishlist of items as well as a favourited items list with more information and detail.
Using ruby, sinatra, pg gem, httparty gem, postgresql we combine these utilities to make an app

## Cool tech that I used

Httparty for API handling
PG for database handling to run through postgresql
Heroku App hosting website and database

## Lessons you learnt

API keys are not always consistent with keys.
How to pass data to and from ruby to html.

## Features to add in the future

Edit username
Javascript DOM manipulation
