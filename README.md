## My plan / Approach
Make a database with tables for users and user's custom selection of items.
User can select a wishlist of items as well as a favourited items list with more information and detail.
Using ruby, sinatra, pg gem, httparty gem, postgresql we combine these utilities to make an app

When user signs up, they can now log in and add things to their colelction. This will be unique to each user.
