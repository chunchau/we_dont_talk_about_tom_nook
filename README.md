# We Hate Tom Nook
This project is an organiser and tracker for those who like to organise your item collection in Animal Crossing: New Horizons

## My plan / Approach
Make a database with tables for users and user's custom selection of items.
User can select a wishlist of items as well as a favourited items list with more information and detail.
Using ruby, sinatra, pg gem, httparty gem, postgresql we combine these utilities to make an app

## Cool tech that I used

Httparty for API handling
PG for database handling to run through postgresql
Heroku App hosting website and database

## Lessons you learnt

API keys are not always consistent with keys.
Have more than one method to identify items in order for redundancy
How to pass data to and from ruby to html.

## Features to add in the future
Fossils page
Furniture pages
Edit username
Javascript DOM manipulation
